# Cars_Project
In Tools 1, we are concerned with data cleaning and exploratory analysis. Please select a
project that has enough scope for the following activities.

For the final project, you will create a Github repository for your project and tag it with the label
TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT by the due date. The github repository must have a .ipynb notebook
file with output and associated code. Having output in the notebook cell is very important if your
dataset is big or we won’t be able to run the notebook in a reasonable time.
Also, it is recommended that we should be able to run your project with a Binder link. The binder
link should be in the README.md file. Please check https://mybinder.org/ to see how to create a
Binder link. If this service is down, this step is not required.

Your final report should read like a data-driven story/scientific study (data science). This is
important if you want to publish your story as a blog on the web or share with stakeholders.
Scientific publications have their own style and content requirements.

Use code cells and markdown cells to carry out your analysis. Please write the report using the
following section format guidelines. You can create more sections if it is more natural to do so,
depending on your project. Please write each section like a report and address the points
mentioned in the following rubric. Try to make your report more enjoyable to read.

● Proper tagging of Github repository for final report as per deadlines (0.5)\
● Dataset and motivation slide (1)\
	- How/why the dataset was collected and a description of the metadata of your dataset.\
● Actual task definition/research question (2)\
	- What real-world problem are you trying to solve? What are the input and output of your analysis?\
● Literature review (2)\
	- What other work has been done in this area, and how is your work novel compared to others?\
● Quality of cleaning (6)\
	- Data cleaning and type conversion activity. Please share anything unusual you faced
	  during this activity.\
	- What did you do about missing values and why? Handling missing values
	  properly is very important.\
	- New feature/attribute creation and data summary statistics and interpretation.\
● Visualization (8)\
	- Data visualization activity (box plot, bar plot, violin plot, and pairplot to see
	  relationships and distribution, etc.).\
	- Describe anything you find in the data after each visualization.\
	- What data visualization helped you understand about data distribution.\
	- What you did about possible outlier as per data distribution visualization. (Did you
	  confirm with your client whether it is actually an outlier or put a disclosure statement in your
	  notebook if you decided to remove it?)
